        <p>This is a very small, unimportant website. But it will soon turn into a rainbow spectacle.
            Currently the red is finished aside from future articles. The orange section will be about books.
            The yellow section will be about fun puzzle games like rebus puzzles. The green section will include
            fun car trip games like wavelength, where a person(not driving Obviously)will recieve a number 1-10
            and a catagory like speed or temperature. They will give a clue related to the category, in hopes 
            that the other travelers guess the correct number. The blue section will include silly games and 
            things like a daily question machine. It will prompt the user a silly question like, "What does the 
            Kool-aid man actually say when he breaks through the wall?". The user would input a funny answer like,
            "wrong house. woopsedoodle" and then submit it. They will then be able to vote for the funniest answer.
            The next day, a new silly question will be asked, but will also display last day's winner. <br><br>Things 
            that will be included but just too broad to be put in a previous section will be below. A cookbook of bob#3's 
            favorite recipes they found. A page that asks questions and then finds the perfect bookclub place(may be an app!).
            Other ideas are still on the way. Bob#3 has many things planned for CURIOUSITY web. If it doesn't appeal to you yet 
            it most certaintly will. It isn't just science articles or books. It's games for children, adults, cartrips, and for fun.
            So however you find fun, Bob#3 will try to put on the website.
