        <p><em>The Eureka Movement has not been put in place. It is a suggestion made by the author.</em>
            <br><br>New math has been put in place for giving students a better education. Though the perfect
            The math curriculum(The Eureka Movement)is very different. The perfect math curriculum would include
            more logic than diagrams. Though diagrams help visualize a problem, they hurt student's development.
            This overtime ruins children's frontal cortex. This is the place responsible for mental math and
            decision making. By writing everything out, the frontal cortex doesn't expand. For the ideal curriculum,
            students of earlier grades would work on mental math skills. Students in 2nd, 3rd and 4th would continue
            this, but start learning how to enhance their logic, so they can solve problems without having to visualize
            it on paper, but in their head.<br><br>Logic skills would be implemented such as algorithms, coding, and more.
            New topics may be taught to find an algorithm. Such as finding formulas for different geometric shapes. Students
            before or when new math began, would study these formulas but not know why. New math tries to implement why,
            though a better idea is if they find it for themselves.<br><br>Coding would be taught as early as kindergarten.
            They would learn about rule following as well as algorithms, like "walk ten steps, turn left", though higher
            elementary schoolers would do projects such as a platformer, calculator and more. Middle schoolers would be taught
            python to make different calculations and games. In highschool, it would be optional web development(Html,CSS,javascript)
            course or others<br><br>This would take a long time to implement thus The Eureka Movement. Teachers would start by
            implementing logic in the curriculums that they teach. Schools would start rescheduling their classes so students can
            focus more on certain topics. This change will take a long time even if teachers would approve. But this would be a great
            improvement on American math curriculums and schools in general.
