        <p>We are 3 dimensional creatures. We live in the 3rd dimenson. We operate under
            length, width, and height. A 2 dimensional creature operates under length and width.
            A one dimensional creature operates under just length. But what would a 4th dimensional
            creature look like?<br><br> A on dimensional creature operates on a single line. If you gave
            this creature two dimensions, It would be 4 lines forming a box. This box would be a 
            rectangle. Each adjacent line would be perpindicular to each other. Now imagine this box in the 
            3rd dimension. This would be 12 lines. Each line would be perpindicular to its adjacent. So 
            we know that each new dimension is perpindicular to the previous dimension. Now imagine a cube, 
            and we added 20 lines, each perpindicular to each adjacent side. This would be a 4 dimensional 
            shape. So what is the 4th dimension? It's time.<br><br> Let's use this new knowledge in a problem.
            Imagine your in a one dimensional prison. How do you escape? You should escape through the second 
            dimension. Now imagine you're in a 2 dimensional prison. How do you escape? You escape through the 
            third dimension. Now how do you escape through a 3rd dimensional prison? Obviously the 4th dimension.
            But why. The previous were easy because they are dimensions of units; length, width, height. But the 
            4th dimension is different. It is a unit of time. In simplist terms. You would use the 4th dimension
            to time travel to a time when you weren't in prison.<br><br>
