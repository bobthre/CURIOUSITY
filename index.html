        <p>Infinity is often misthought as calculus. Though infinity is its own wonder! Many math parts can be visualized,
            but not infinity. This is because there isn't a finite(countable) amount. Infinity is abstract, and hard to
            explain. <br><br>Infinity can be lead starting at 1, then 2, then 3, all the way till infinity. But also, the string of
            numbers are infinite. So there are 2 infinities. Though you can start at 0, then 1/2, then 1, so on and so on. It still
            counts to infinity but the string is longer then the first string though they both have a string length of infinity.
            So that means there must be infinite infinities. <br><br> The first string of numbers are separated by whole numbers.
            Mathematicians call this aleph 0. Another infinity can be made from all numbers. You would start at 0. You couldn't count
             any higher because the next number is infinitely small. <br><br> Lets visualize this in a hotel. The infinite hotel. A hotel with
            infinite rooms. Imagine all the rooms are full.Then another guest comes. You can't tell him to leave or you'll be fired.
            So you say on the intercom, for everyone to move one room down. 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 3, so on and so on. This means room
            one will be empty and the extra person can go in that room.<br><br> Now imagine an infinite number of people trying to get a room.
            You should say on the intercom that everyone should move to double their room number. 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 4, 3 goes to 6,
            so on and so on. That means an infinite number of odd rooms will be free. So an infinite number of people can stay.
            <br><br> Now let's imagine a new problem. Imagine two students have an infinitely big vase and an infinite amount of balls.
            The rule is to put 10 balls in the vase and take one out. Then you will repeat this process until there are no balls left.
            Students A and B both do this. Student A ends up with an infinite amount of balls in her vase, which seems cynical. Though
            student B has 0 balls in her vase. Student A's is very understandable of her result but student B's is unclear. She says this
            is her result because she put an infinite amount of balls but took an infinite amount out, thus the result of 0. Here's the weird
            part, both student A and student B are correct! Infinity has trouble doing arithmetic which is intended for finite numbers. It was
            very challenging to find alpha 0 and other infinities. <br><br> It should be clear, using infinity is a confusing wonder and is
            very complex. It should also be understood that a sum of an infinite series doesn't always equal infinity. That is a consept that
            tricked mathmaticians. Imagine a vase with a finite volume but infinite surface area. This stumped mathematicians because it would
            require an infinite amount of paint to coat its surface area but if you dumped a finite amount of paint into the vase, you can coat the
            sides with a finite amount of paint. This works because it is essentially comparing feet to years. They don't converge.
